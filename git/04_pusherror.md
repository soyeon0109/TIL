 # push 실패.
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/edutak/first.git'
# 원격저장소 작업이 로컬저장소에 없다.
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. 
# 원격저장소 변경사항들(remote changes - 커밋)를 먼저 통합시키는 것을 아마도 원할 것..
# 다시 push하기전에 (git pull ...?)
You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

* 커밋 메시지를 작성하는 창이 나타난다. (vim 환경)
  * 저장하고 나가는 법 : `esc` + `:wq` 
* 원격저장소의 커밋과 로컬의 커밋을 병합하는 커밋이 발생함
* 다시 push
